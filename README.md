# Decentralized Autonomous Arbitration System

A blockchain-based smart contract system that enables decentralized dispute resolution through a jury-based arbitration mechanism. This system allows users to submit cases, present evidence, and have disputes resolved by randomly selected jurors from a pool of volunteers.

## Features

- Case submission and management
- Evidence submission system
- Decentralized jury selection
- Secure voting mechanism
- Automated case lifecycle management
- Transparent verdict recording

## System Components

### Role-based Access

- **Contract Owner**: Administrative privileges for system maintenance and case finalization
- **Plaintiffs**: Users who can submit cases
- **Defendants**: Users who respond to cases
- **Jurors**: Volunteers who review cases and cast votes

### Case States

1. **Pending**: Initial state after case submission
2. **Active**: Case is assigned jurors and accepting votes
3. **Resolved**: Final state after verdict is recorded

### Core Functions

#### Case Management
- `submit-case`: Create a new arbitration case
- `add-evidence`: Submit evidence for an existing case
- `get-case`: Retrieve case details
- `get-user-cases`: List all cases associated with a user

#### Jury System
- `volunteer-as-juror`: Join the juror pool
- `select-jurors`: Randomly select jurors for a case
- `get-juror-pool`: View current juror pool

#### Voting and Resolution
- `cast-vote`: Submit a juror's vote
- `finalize-case`: Record final verdict and close case

## Usage

### Submitting a Case

```clarity
(contract-call? .arbitration-system submit-case 
    'SP2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKNRV9EJ7 
    "Description of the dispute")
```

### Adding Evidence

```clarity
(contract-call? .arbitration-system add-evidence 
    u1 
    "QmX4zdJ6dKHGVYw8nBn4RxqYXRiUhM9JLzXyFqZ6mZzZzZ")
```

### Volunteering as Juror

```clarity
(contract-call? .arbitration-system volunteer-as-juror)
```

### Casting a Vote

```clarity
(contract-call? .arbitration-system cast-vote u1 u1)
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Only the contract owner can finalize cases and select jurors
- Only case participants can submit evidence
- Only selected jurors can vote on their assigned cases

### Time Constraints
- Evidence submission and voting are restricted by case deadlines
- Cases can only be finalized after the deadline has passed

### System Limits
- Maximum of 1000 jurors in the pool
- Maximum of 5 jurors per case
- Maximum of 10 pieces of evidence per case
- Maximum of 100 cases per user

## Error Codes

- `err-owner-only (u100)`: Action restricted to contract owner
- `err-not-found (u101)`: Requested resource not found
- `err-unauthorized (u102)`: User not authorized for action
- `err-already-exists (u103)`: Resource already exists
- `err-invalid-state (u104)`: Invalid state transition
- `err-deadline-passed (u105)`: Action attempted after deadline
- `err-insufficient-jurors (u106)`: Not enough jurors available

## Technical Requirements

- Clarity smart contract language
- Stacks blockchain compatible
- Support for principal types and string-utf8 encoding

## Implementation Notes

- Case descriptions are limited to 500 bytes
- Evidence hashes should be IPFS compatible
- Voting mechanism uses simple uint values
- Random juror selection uses block hash for entropy

## Future Improvements

1. Implement staking mechanism for jurors
2. Add appeals process
3. Introduce reputation system
4. Support for multiple verdict options
5. Add case categorization
6. Implement juror rewards system
